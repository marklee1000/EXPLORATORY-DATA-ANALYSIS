- `Customer_ID`: Unique identifier for each customer

- `Gender`: Male or Female

- `Age`: Customerâ€™s age in years

- `Browsing_Time`: Average time spent on the website per visit (in
  minutes)

- `Purchase_Amount`: Total amount spent in a single transaction (in USD)

- `Number_of_Items`: Number of items purchased per transaction

- `Discount_Applied`: Discount percentage applied to the transaction

- `Total_Transactions`: Total number of transactions by the customer

- `Category`: Product category (e.g., Electronics, Clothing, Home &
  Kitchen, etc.)

- `Satisfaction_Score`: Customer satisfaction score (1-5 scale)

**The dataset consists of 3000 entries and 10 columns, having both
nominal and ordinal variables.**

## 2. Create histograms and boxplots to visualize the distribution of `Purchase_Amount`, `Number_of_Items`, and `Satisfaction_Score`.

**Solution.**

``` r
purchase_histo <- ggplot(data, aes(x = Purchase_Amount)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, fill = "pink", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Purchase Amount",
       x = "Purchase Amount",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
purchase_boxplot <- ggplot(data, aes(x = "", y = Purchase_Amount)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "pink", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Purchase Amount",
       x = "",
       y = "Purchase Amount") +
  theme_minimal()
purchase_plots <- plot_grid(purchase_histo, purchase_boxplot, labels = c("A", "B"), ncol = 2, align = "h")
purchase_plots
```

``` r
num_items_histo <- ggplot(data, aes(x = Number_of_Items)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "pink", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Number of Items",
       x = "Number of Items",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
num_items_boxplot <- ggplot(data, aes(x = "", y = Number_of_Items)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "pink", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Number of Items",
       x = "",
       y = "Number of Items") +
  theme_minimal()
num_items_plots <- plot_grid(num_items_histo, num_items_boxplot, labels = c("A", "B"), ncol = 2, align = "h")
num_items_plots
```

![](SEC-1-SA-1-MAYOL,-J_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

**Since *Number_of_Items* is a discrete variable, *geom_bar* was used
instead of *geom_histogram*.**

``` r
satisfaction_histo <- ggplot(data, aes(x = Satisfaction_Score)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "pink", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Satisfaction Score",
       x = "Satisfaction Score",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
satisfaction_boxplot <- ggplot(data, aes(x = "", y = Satisfaction_Score)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "pink", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Satisfaction Score",
       x = "",
       y = "Satisfaction Score") +
  theme_minimal()
satisfaction_plots <- plot_grid(satisfaction_histo, satisfaction_boxplot, labels = c("A", "B"), ncol = 2, align = "h")
satisfaction_plots
```

![](SEC-1-SA-1-MAYOL,-J_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

**Just like with** ***Number_of_Items*, *geom_bar* was used for
*Satisfaction_Score* instead of *geom_histogram* since it consists of
discrete values.**

**One notable thing to notice about the boxplots is that none of the
investigated columns have any outliers. This implies that no extreme
values will skew the results of any further investigation.**

## 3. Compute measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and spread (variance, standard deviation, IQR) for `Purchase_Amount`.

**Solution.**

``` r
library(flextable)
```

    ## Warning: package 'flextable' was built under R version 4.4.3

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'flextable'

    ## The following object is masked from 'package:purrr':
    ## 
    ##     compose

``` r
mean_purchase <- mean(data$Purchase_Amount, na.rm = TRUE)
median_purchase <- median(data$Purchase_Amount, na.rm = TRUE)
mode_purchase <- as.numeric(names(sort(table(data$Purchase_Amount), decreasing = TRUE)[1]))
variance_purchase <- var(data$Purchase_Amount, na.rm = TRUE)
sd_purchase <- sd(data$Purchase_Amount, na.rm = TRUE)
iqr_purchase <- IQR(data$Purchase_Amount, na.rm = TRUE)

central_spread_purchase <- data.frame(
  Statistic = c("Mean", "Median", "Mode", "Variance", "Standard Deviation", "IQR"),
  Value = c(mean_purchase, median_purchase, mode_purchase, variance_purchase, sd_purchase, iqr_purchase)
)

central_spread_purchase %>%
  flextable() %>%
  set_caption("Table 1: Summary Statistics for Purchase Amount")
```

![](SEC-1-SA-1-MAYOL,-J_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

**The table shows the measures of central tendencies and spread of
*Purchase_Amount*.**

## 4. Compare the distribution of `Browsing_Time` and `Purchase_Amount` across different `Gender` groups using density plots.

**Solution.**

``` r
browsing_time_density <- ggplot(data, aes(x = Browsing_Time, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Browsing Time by Gender",
       x = "Browsing Time",
       y = "Density") +
  theme_minimal()

purchase_density <- ggplot(data, aes(x = Purchase_Amount, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Purchase Amount by Gender",
       x = "Purchase Amount",
       y = "Density") +
  theme_minimal()

density_plots <- plot_grid(browsing_time_density, purchase_density, labels = c("A", "B"), ncol = 2, align = "h")

density_plots
```

![](SEC-1-SA-1-MAYOL,-J_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- -->

**For Browsing Time, the female group approaches a symmetric
distribution with a small peak on the left, while the male group has a
right skew with two small peaks on the right. In the Purchase Amount
density plots, the male group has a more symmetric distribution with a
small peak on the left. This time, the female group has two peaks, both
of which lie on relatively opposite sides of the graph.**

## 5. Apply a logarithmic or square root transformation on `Browsing_Time` and evaluate changes in skewness.

**Solution.**

``` r
data$log_Browsing_Time <- log(data$Browsing_Time)

log_browsing_time_density <- ggplot(data, aes(x = log_Browsing_Time, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Log-Transformed Browsing Time by Gender",
       x = "Log-Transformed Browsing Time",
       y = "Density") +
  theme_minimal()

log_browsing_time_density
```

![](SEC-1-SA-1-MAYOL,-J_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- -->

**After log-transforming, the density plots of *Browsing_Time* for both
female and male groups now have a prominent left skew. Let us see what
happens when we do a square root transformation instead.**

``` r
data$sqrt_Browsing_Time <- sqrt(data$Browsing_Time)

sqrt_browsing_time_density <- ggplot(data, aes(x = sqrt_Browsing_Time, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Sqrt-Transformed Browsing Time by Gender",
       x = "Sqrt-Transformed Browsing Time",
       y = "Density") +
  theme_minimal()

sqrt_browsing_time_density
```

![](SEC-1-SA-1-MAYOL,-J_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)<!-- -->

**Square-root transformation of *Browsing_Time* yielded density plots
that were â€˜thickerâ€™ than that of the logarithm. As shown in the graph,
both groups also have a left skew, though not as pronounced as the
log-transformed data.**

## 6. Fit a simple linear regression model predicting `Purchase_Amount` based on `Browsing_Time`. Interpret the results.

**Solution.**

``` r
purchase_browsing_fx <- lm(Purchase_Amount ~ Browsing_Time, data = data)
purchase_browsing_fx
```

    ## 
    ## Call:
    ## lm(formula = Purchase_Amount ~ Browsing_Time, data = data)
    ## 
    ## Coefficients:
    ##   (Intercept)  Browsing_Time  
    ##     252.65596       -0.07839

**As the slope is negative, purchase amount decreases as browsing time
increases. This inverse relationship may suggest that customers become
more dissuaded to purchase as they spend more time browsing and not
giving into impulse.**

## 7. Use `ggplot2` (or equivalent) to create scatter plots and regression lines.

**Solution.**

``` r
purchase_browsing_line <- ggplot(data, aes(x = Browsing_Time, y = Purchase_Amount)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", se = TRUE) +  
  labs(title = "Purchase Amount vs Browsing Time",
       x = "Browsing Time",
       y = "Purchase Amount") +
  theme_minimal()
purchase_browsing_line
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'

![](SEC-1-SA-1-MAYOL,-J_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)<!-- -->

**Note that the y-axis has been compressed to fit the graph better on
the screen. As suggested by the line of fit (in red), purchase_amount
decreases as browsing time increases.**

# **Unit 2: Bivariate Data Analysis**

## 8. Create scatter plots to explore the relationship between `Purchase_Amount` and `Number_of_Items`.

**Solution.**

``` r
purchase_items_line <- ggplot(data, aes(x = Number_of_Items, y = Purchase_Amount)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(title = "Purchase Amount vs Number of Items",
       x = "Number of Items",
       y = "Purchase Amount") +
  theme_minimal()
purchase_items_line
```

![](SEC-1-SA-1-MAYOL,-J_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)<!-- -->

**Judging by the scatterplot, there seems to be no relationship between
the two variables. Hence, it is suggested that the number of items
bought has no implication on the total price of an order.**

## 9. Fit a polynomial regression model for `Purchase_Amount` and `Browsing_Time` and compare it with a simple linear model.

**Solution.**

**First, we will have to find an optimal degree for the polynomial
regression model using an ANOVA test.**

``` r
fit_2 <- lm(Purchase_Amount ~ poly(Browsing_Time, 2), data = data)
fit_3 <- lm(Purchase_Amount ~ poly(Browsing_Time, 3), data = data)
fit_4 <- lm(Purchase_Amount ~ poly(Browsing_Time, 4), data = data)
fit_5 <- lm(Purchase_Amount ~ poly(Browsing_Time, 5), data = data)
anova(purchase_browsing_fx, fit_2,fit_3,fit_4,fit_5)
```

    ## Analysis of Variance Table
    ## 
    ## Model 1: Purchase_Amount ~ Browsing_Time
    ## Model 2: Purchase_Amount ~ poly(Browsing_Time, 2)
    ## Model 3: Purchase_Amount ~ poly(Browsing_Time, 3)
    ## Model 4: Purchase_Amount ~ poly(Browsing_Time, 4)
    ## Model 5: Purchase_Amount ~ poly(Browsing_Time, 5)
    ##   Res.Df      RSS Df Sum of Sq      F Pr(>F)
    ## 1   2998 59496437                           
    ## 2   2997 59491795  1      4642 0.2338 0.6287
    ## 3   2996 59447052  1     44744 2.2540 0.1334
    ## 4   2995 59447049  1         3 0.0002 0.9901
    ## 5   2994 59434444  1     12604 0.6349 0.4256

**None of the p values are less than 0.05. Hence, there is no point in
choosing a higher number and we could just use a degree of 2.**

``` r
purchase_browsing_line2 <- ggplot(data, aes(x = Browsing_Time, y = Purchase_Amount)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", se = TRUE) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ poly(x, 2), color = "green", se = TRUE) +
  labs(title = "Comparison of Linear and Polynomial Regression",
       x = "Browsing Time",
       y = "Purchase Amount",
       caption = "Red = Linear | Green = Quadratic") +
  theme_minimal()
purchase_browsing_line2
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'

![](SEC-1-SA-1-MAYOL,-J_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png)<!-- -->

**The values for both linear and polynomial regression models are
visually close. Since the p-values for both models are also below 0.05
as shown earlier, then none of these are functional.**

## 10. Apply LOESS (Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing) to `Purchase_Amount` vs.Â `Browsing_Time` and visualize the results.

**Solution.**

``` r
purchase_browsing_loess <- ggplot(data, aes(x = Browsing_Time, y = Purchase_Amount)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "red", se = TRUE)
  labs(title = "LOESS Model for Purchase Amount vs Browsing Time",
       x = "Browsing Time",
       y = "Purchase Amount") +
  theme_minimal()
```

    ## NULL

``` r
purchase_browsing_loess
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'

![](SEC-1-SA-1-MAYOL,-J_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png)<!-- -->

**The LOESS curve is not a straight line but is close to the earlier
simple regression line. This suggests that the true relationship of
*Purchase_Amount* and *Browsing_Time* can be expressed linearly.**

## 11. Compare robust regression methods (Huber or Tukey regression) with ordinary least squares (OLS).

**Solution.**

``` r
library(MASS)
```

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'MASS'

    ## The following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':

**All three of the regression models follow very similar paths. Hence,
there seems to be no significant difference between the three in terms
of representing the relationship between *Purchase_Amount* and
*Browsing_Time*. Let us try comparing the actual equations themselves.**

**As expected, the equations for the three regression models are
extremely close with one another. This is in line with the findings in
our earlier boxplots that there are no outliers in the dataset.
Furthermore, the data could follow a normal distribution since the
regression lines for Huber and Tukey are almost exactly the same as OLS,
which assumes normally-distributed data. This is also congruent with the
finding from the LOESS, suggesting that a linear fit is sufficient for
the data.**

# **Unit 3: Trivariate/Hypervariate Data Analysis**

## 12. Explore interaction effects between `Browsing_Time` and `Category` on `Purchase_Amount` using interaction plots.

**Solution.**

``` r
interaction.plot(x.factor = data$Browsing_Time,
                 trace.factor = data$Category,
                 response = data$Purchase_Amount,
                 fun = mean,
                 col = rainbow(length(unique(data$Category))),
                 lty = 1,
                 xlab = "Browsing Time",
                 ylab = "Purchase Amount",
                 main = "Interaction Plot: Browsing Time & Category on Purchase Amount")
```

![](SEC-1-SA-1-MAYOL,-J_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png)<!-- -->

**The interaction plot is cluttered and hard to read. Let us try
applying LOESS smoothing to**

``` r
ggplot(data, aes(x = Browsing_Time, y = Purchase_Amount, color = Category)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "LOESS Interaction Plot: Browsing Time & Category",
       x = "Browsing Time",
       y = "Purchase Amount",
       color = "Category") +
  theme_minimal()
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'

![](SEC-1-SA-1-MAYOL,-J_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png)<!-- -->

**Each category follow a different trend. For instance, Books rises then
drops while Electronics is in reverse. Since the lines cross, this
suggests that the effect of *Browsing_Time* on *Purchase_Amount* differs
depending on the *Category*. Also, since the different curves have
varying peaks and dips, then our previous interpretations of the
relationship between *Purchase_Amount* and *Browsing_Time* being
sufficiently described as linear may hold less validity now.**

## 13. Create coplots of `Purchase_Amount` against `Browsing_Time` for different levels of `Category`.

**Solution.**

``` r
ggplot(data, aes(x = Browsing_Time, y = Purchase_Amount)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE, color = "red") +  
  facet_wrap(~Category) +
  labs(title = "Purchase Amount vs Browsing Time by Category",
       x = "Browsing Time",
       y = "Purchase Amount") +
  theme_minimal()
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'

![](SEC-1-SA-1-MAYOL,-J_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png)<!-- -->

**From the coplots, we can see that *Browsing_Time* has a direct
relationship with *Purchase_Amount* under the Beauty and Clothing
categories. The opposite can be said about the Books and Home & Kitchen
categories, which seemingly exhibit an inverse relationship. Unlike all
the others, a slight parabolic relationship can be made from the
Electronics category.**

## 14. Use level plots or contour plots to visualize relationships between `Browsing_Time`, `Number_of_Items`, and `Purchase_Amount`.

**Solution.**

``` r
ggplot(data, aes(x = Browsing_Time, y = Number_of_Items, fill = Purchase_Amount)) +
  geom_tile() + 
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  labs(title = "Level Plot: Browsing Time vs Number of Items",
       x = "Browsing Time",
       y = "Number of Items",
       fill = "Purchase Amount") +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](SEC-1-SA-1-MAYOL,-J_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png)<!-- -->

**The data is too sparse to make a proper level plot. We need to fill in
the gaps by binning *Browsing_Time* and *Number_of_Items*.**

``` r
data_binned <- data %>%
  mutate(
    Browsing_Time_bin = cut(Browsing_Time, breaks = 10), 
    Number_of_Items_bin = cut(Number_of_Items, breaks = 5)
  ) %>%
  group_by(Browsing_Time_bin, Number_of_Items_bin) %>%
  summarize(Purchase_Amount = mean(Purchase_Amount, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

ggplot(data_binned, aes(x = Browsing_Time_bin, y = Number_of_Items_bin, fill = Purchase_Amount)) +
  geom_tile() +  
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  labs(title = "Binned Level Plot: Browsing Time vs Number of Items",
       x = "Browsing Time (Binned)", y = "Number of Items (Binned)",
       fill = "Purchase Amount") +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](SEC-1-SA-1-MAYOL,-J_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png)<!-- -->

**At first glance, there seems to be no apparent trend in the data.
However, we can see that darker boxes appear frequently when more items
are purchased. The inverse can be said about lower bought items, where
dark boxes appear less or donâ€™t even appear at all. This seems to
suggest that *Purchase_Amount* increases with *Number_of_Items*
sometimes, but not always. Another variable has the same trend** â€”
**more dark boxes appear when *Browsing_Time* is higher and vice versa,
but also not always. Hence, both *Number_of_Items and Browsing_Time*
influence the *Purchase_Amount*** **but not in a completely linear
manner.**

## 15. Perform multiple regression with `Purchase_Amount` as the dependent variable and `Browsing_Time`, `Number_of_Items`, and `Satisfaction_Score` as predictors. Perform model selection and assess variable importance.

**Solution.**

``` r
multiple_model <- lm(Purchase_Amount ~ Browsing_Time + Number_of_Items + Satisfaction_Score, data = data)
summary(multiple_model)
```

    ## 
    ## Call:
    ## lm(formula = Purchase_Amount ~ Browsing_Time + Number_of_Items + 
    ##     Satisfaction_Score, data = data)
    ## 
    ## Residuals:

    ## Browsing_Time       -0.07954    0.07504  -1.060    0.289    
    ## Number_of_Items     -0.78321    1.00497  -0.779    0.436

    ## F-statistic: 0.7928 on 3 and 2996 DF,  p-value: 0.4978

**The p-values for *Browsing_Time*, *Number_of_Items*, and
*Satisfaction_Score* are all above 0.05. This means that there are no
significant relationships with any of the variables. The low R-squared
and F-statistic further corroborate this point. Thus, *Browsing_Time*,
*Number_of_Items*, and *Satisfaction_Score* do not predict
*Purchase_Amount* in any statistically sound way.**

**As expected, adding predictors does not improve model performance

having the lowest AIC among the three, is still not giving satisfactory
